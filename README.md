# Remote_Gas_Detection_System

An IoT device made to monitor the surrounding harmful gass of the key pollinators of our environment i.e. Butterflies. This Device is made using an Arduino UNO (microcontroller ATmega328P) as it's heart and is connected to some gas detecting sensors and then all the readings are sent to a receiver mobile number using a GSM SIM900A Module.

##### This repository consists of three vital files:

1. Code used to get the data from sensors and then send them to recipient mobile number.

2. A scientific documentation of this project (done using LaTex,PDF version).

3. A PPT to understand the project without reading the documentation.
