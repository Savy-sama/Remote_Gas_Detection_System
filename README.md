# Remote_Gas_Detection_System

An IoT device made to monitor the surrounding harmful gass of the key pollinators of our environment i.e. Butterflies. This Device is made using an Arduino UNO (microcontroller ATmega328P) as it's heart and is connected to some gas detecting sensors and then all the readings are sent to a receiver mobile number using a GSM SIM900A Module. For the remote flexibility and freedom from USB powering it has a external power supply as well.

### This repository consists of three vital files:

1. Code used to get the data from sensors and then send them to recipient mobile number.

2. A scientific documentation of this project (done using LaTex,PDF version).

3. A PPT to understand the project without reading the documentation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


## How to run the code?

1. Download the arudino IDE from `arduino.cc`.
2. Install it and download the `"Project_Code.ino"` file (You can also copy-paste the code).
3. Connect the arduino to the correct port int the arduino IDE.
4. Make sure to `read the code first to understand the pin connection`.
5. If you have any problem try reading the comment next to the code.
6. After the connection is done, click on **"Verify"** to check if there are any errors occuring.
7. After the verification is done, click on **"Upload"**.
8. Click on the `"Serial Monitor"` icon on the right upper side of the screen.
9. Type ***"s"*** in the serial monitor and wait for some time.
